# Centralized Dependency Injection Providers for FastAPI
# This file will contain common FastAPI Depends providers.
# For the initial template, it might be very simple or provide basic examples.

from typing import Annotated, Any # Added Any for placeholder DBSessionDep
from fastapi import Depends

from .config import AppSettings, settings as app_settings # Import AppSettings and the global instance

# Example: Dependency to get application settings
async def get_settings() -> AppSettings:
    return app_settings

# Type alias for dependency injection if preferred
SettingsDep = Annotated[AppSettings, Depends(get_settings)]

# Add other common dependencies here as the template evolves, e.g.:
# async def get_db_session(settings: SettingsDep):
#     # Logic to get a DB session, potentially using settings.MONGO_URI
#     # For now, this is a placeholder.
#     # client = ... connect to mongo ...
#     # db = client[settings.DB_NAME]
#     # yield db # if it's a generator-based session
#     # client.close()
#     pass

# Example DB Session Dependency (placeholder)
# DBSessionDep = Annotated[Any, Depends(get_db_session)] # Replace Any with actual session type
